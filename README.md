# Helsinki screen view

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) & [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design)

## Why?

It's a technical test for a job, I'm trying to gain some experience as a web developer :)

## What you'll find?

A pretty simple view of a travel app (I think) took from a prestigious UI/UX blog, since the only view I got was the mobile one, I decided to design how this view would look like on bigger screens, the design was made on Figma, [here you have it](https://www.figma.com/file/u5fdTdoU7dvf8oW8JBqVwd/Screen-5?node-id=1%3A3). This project will be hosted on Github pages. Hope you like it!
